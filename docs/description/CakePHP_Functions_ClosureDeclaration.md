Maintain consistent syntax and style for closures in CakePHP applications, enhancing readability and maintainability. Adhere to proper placement, indentation, and parameter declaration.

```php
// Issue: Inconsistent closure declaration
$closure = function ($a,$b) {return $a +$b;};

// Solution: Consistent closure declaration
$closure = function ($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
};
```
