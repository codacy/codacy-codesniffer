Ensure your CakePHP code remains clear and maintainable by appropriately managing empty lines. Place empty lines to logically separate code sections, such as between methods or before comments.

```php
// Issue: Excessive empty lines

class UserController extends AppController
{


    public function index()
    {



        // Some functionality
    }


    public function view($id)
    {



        // Some functionality
    }
}

// Solution: Managed empty lines

class UserController extends AppController
{
    public function index()
    {
        // Some functionality
    }
    
    public function view($id)
    {
        // Some functionality
    }
}
```
