## Namespaces: Fully Qualified Global Constants

All references to global constants must be referenced via a fully qualified name.

Sniff provides the following settings:

*   `include`: list of global constants that must be referenced via FQN. If not set all constants are considered.
*   `exclude`: list of global constants that are allowed not to be referenced via FQN.
