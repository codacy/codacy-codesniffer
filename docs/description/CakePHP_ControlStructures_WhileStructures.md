Follow best practices for writing while loops in CakePHP to enhance readability, performance, and prevent logical errors. Ensure consistent structure, efficiency, and safety in your implementations.

```php
// Issue: Inefficient and hard-to-read while loop
$total = 0;
$i = 0;
while ($i < count($items)) {
    $total += $items[$i];
    $i++;
}
// Solution: Optimized and readable while loop
$total = 0;
$i = 0;
$itemCount = count($items);
while ($i < $itemCount) {
    $total += $items[$i];
    $i++;
}
```
