Arrays are essential in Drupal for configurations, theming, and data processing. This pattern helps standardize and optimize how arrays are created and manipulated in Drupal projects.

```php
// Issue: Messy and inconsistent array structure
$settings = ['user' => 'admin', 'status' => 'active'];

// Solution: Standardized array structure for clarity and maintainability
$settings = [
    'user' => 'admin',
    'status' => 'active',
];
```
