Use single quotes for string literals in PHP to enhance performance and maintain coding standards. This applies to plain strings without variable interpolation.

```php
// Issue: Double quotes used unnecessarily
$string = "Hello, World!";

// Solution: Use single quotes for simple strings
$string = 'Hello, World!';
```
