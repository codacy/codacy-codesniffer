Verify all methods in CakePHP classes include return type hints to improve type safety and code quality. For instance, update methods as shown below:

```php
// Issue: Missing return type hint
public function getUserName() { 
    return $this->name; 
}

// Solution: Added return type hint
public function getUserName(): string { 
    return $this->name; 
}
```
