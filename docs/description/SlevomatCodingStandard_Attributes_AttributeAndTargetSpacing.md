## Attributes: Attribute And Target Spacing

Sniff checks lines count between attribute and its target (or target's documentation comment).

Sniff provides the following settings:

*   `allowOnSameLine`: allow attribute and its target to be placed on the same line (default value is false)
*   `linesCount`: lines count between attribute and its target
