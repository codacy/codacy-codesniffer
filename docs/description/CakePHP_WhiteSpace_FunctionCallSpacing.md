Ensure no spaces between the function name and the opening parenthesis, and single spaces after commas in argument lists, for better readability.

```php
// Issue: Inconsistent spacing in function calls
doSomething ($arg1,$arg2, $arg3);

// Solution: Consistent spacing in function calls
doSomething($arg1, $arg2, $arg3);
```
