## Classes: Class Length

Disallows long classes. This sniff provides the following settings:

*   `includeComments`: should comments be included in the count (default value is false).
*   `includeWhitespace`: should empty lines be included in the count (default value is false).
*   `maxLinesLength`: specifies max allowed function lines length (default value is 250).
