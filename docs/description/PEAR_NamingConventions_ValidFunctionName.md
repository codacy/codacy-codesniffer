Functions and methods should be named using the "studly caps" style (also referred to as "bumpy case" or "camel caps"). Functions should in addition have the package name as a prefix, to avoid name collisions between packages. The initial letter of the name (after the prefix) is lowercase, and each letter that starts a new "word" is capitalized.

Examples of valid function names
```
connect()
getData()
buildSomeWidget()
XML_RPC_serializeData()
```

Examples of invalid function names

get_data()
