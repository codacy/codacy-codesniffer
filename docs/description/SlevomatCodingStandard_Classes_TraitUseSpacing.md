Sniff provides the following settings:

*   `linesCountBeforeFirstUse`: allows to configure the number of lines before first `use`.
*   `linesCountBeforeFirstUseWhenFirstInClass`: allows to configure the number of lines before first `use` when the `use` is the first statement in the class.
*   `linesCountBetweenUses`: allows to configure the number of lines between two `use` statements.
*   `linesCountAfterLastUse`: allows to configure the number of lines after last `use`.
*   `linesCountAfterLastUseWhenLastInClass`: allows to configure the number of lines after last `use` when the `use` is the last statement in the class.
