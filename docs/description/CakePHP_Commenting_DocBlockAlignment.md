Maintain uniform alignment of DocBlocks in CakePHP to enhance readability and documentation quality. Align annotations and description details properly to conform to best practices.

```php
/**
 * Calculate the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param int $a First number.
 * @param int $b Second number.
 * @return int Sum of numbers.
 */
function sum($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}
```
