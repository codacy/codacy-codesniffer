Function declarations follow the "Kernighan/Ritchie style". The function brace is on the same line as the function declaration. One space is required between the closing parenthesis and the brace.

Valid: brace on same line
```
function fooFunction($arg1, $arg2 = '') {
    ...
}
```

Invalid: brace on next line
```
function fooFunction($arg1, $arg2 = '')
{
    ...
}
```
