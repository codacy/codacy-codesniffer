Detect declaration of a namespaced function called `assert()`.
As of PHP 7. 3, a compile-time deprecation warning will be thrown when a function
called `assert()` is declared.  In PHP 8 this will become a compile-error. 

Methods are unaffected. 
Global, non-namespaced, `assert()` function declarations were always a fatal
"function already declared" error, so not the concern of this sniff.
