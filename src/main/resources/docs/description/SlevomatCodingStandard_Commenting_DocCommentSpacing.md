## Commenting: Doc Comment Spacing

Enforces configurable number of lines before first content (description or annotation), after last content (description or annotation),
between description and annotations, between two different annotation types (eg. between `@param` and `@return`).

Sniff provides the following settings:

* `linesCountBeforeFirstContent`: allows to configure the number of lines before first content (description or annotation).
* `linesCountBetweenDescriptionAndAnnotations`: allows to configure the number of lines between description and annotations.
* `linesCountBetweenDifferentAnnotationsTypes`: allows to configure the number of lines between two different annotation types.
* `linesCountBetweenAnnotationsGroups`: allows to configure the number of lines between annotation groups.
* `linesCountAfterLastContent`: allows to configure the number of lines after last content (description or annotation).
* `annotationsGroups`: allows to configure order of annotation groups and even order of annotations in every group. Supports prefixes, eg. `@ORM\`.

```xml
<rule ref="SlevomatCodingStandard.Commenting.DocCommentSpacing">
	<properties>
		<property name="annotationsGroups" type="array">
			<element value="
				@ORM\,
			"/>
			<element value="
				@var,
				@param,
				@return,
			"/>
		</property>
	</properties>
</rule>
```

If `annotationsGroups` is set, `linesCountBetweenDifferentAnnotationsTypes` is ignored and `linesCountBetweenAnnotationsGroups` is applied.
If `annotationsGroups` is not set, `linesCountBetweenAnnotationsGroups` is ignored and `linesCountBetweenDifferentAnnotationsTypes` is applied.

Annotations not in any group are placed to automatically created last group.
