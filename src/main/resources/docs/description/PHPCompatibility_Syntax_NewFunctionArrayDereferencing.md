Detect function array dereferencing as introduced in PHP 5.4.
PHP 5. 4 supports direct array dereferencing on the return of a method/function call. 

As of PHP 7. 0, this also works when using curly braces for the dereferencing. 
While unclear, this most likely has to do with the Uniform Variable Syntax changes.
