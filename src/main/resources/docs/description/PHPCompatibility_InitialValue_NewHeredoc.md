Detect a heredoc being used to set an initial value.
As of PHP 5. 3. 0, it's possible to initialize static variables, class properties
and constants declared using the `const` keyword, using the Heredoc syntax. 
And while not documented, heredoc initialization can now also be used for function param defaults. 
See: https://3v4l. org/JVH8W

These heredocs (still) cannot contain variables.  That's, however, outside the scope of the
PHPCompatibility library until such time as there is a PHP version in which this would be accepted.
