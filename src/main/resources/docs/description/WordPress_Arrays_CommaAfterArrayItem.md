Enforces a comma after each array item and the spacing around it.Rules:
- For multi-line arrays, a comma is needed after each array item.
- Same for single-line arrays, but no comma is allowed after the last array item.
- There should be no space between the comma and the end of the array item.
- There should be exactly one space between the comma and the start of the
  next array item for single-line items.
