Detect passing `$encoding` to `mb_strrpos()` as 3rd argument.
The `$encoding` parameter was moved from the third position to the fourth in PHP 5. 2. 0. 
For backward compatibility, `$encoding` could be specified as the third parameter, but doing
so is deprecated and will be removed in the future. 

Between PHP 5. 2 and PHP 7. 3, this was a deprecation in documentation only. 
As of PHP 7. 4, a deprecation warning will be thrown if an encoding is passed as the 3rd
argument. 
As of PHP 8, the argument is expected to change to accept an integer only.
