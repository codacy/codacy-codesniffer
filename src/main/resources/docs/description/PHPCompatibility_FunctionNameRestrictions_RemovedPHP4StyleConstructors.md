Detect declarations of PHP 4 style constructors which are deprecated as of PHP 7.0.0.
PHP 4 style constructors - methods that have the same name as the class they are defined in -
are deprecated as of PHP 7. 0. 0, and will be removed in the future. 
PHP 7 will emit `E_DEPRECATED` if a PHP 4 constructor is the only constructor defined
within a class.  Classes that implement a `__construct()` method are unaffected. 

Note: Methods with the same name as the class they are defined in _within a namespace_
are not recognized as constructors anyway and therefore outside the scope of this sniff.
