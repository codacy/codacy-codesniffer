## Functions: Function Length

Disallows long functions. This sniff provides the following setting:

* `includeComments`: should comments be included in the count (default value is false).
* `includeWhitespace`: should empty lines be included in the count (default value is false).
* `maxLinesLength`: specifies max allowed function lines length (default value is 20).
