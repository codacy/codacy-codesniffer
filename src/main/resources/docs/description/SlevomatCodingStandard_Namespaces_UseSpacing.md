## Namespaces: Use Spacing

Enforces configurable number of lines before first `use`, after last `use` and between two different types of `use` (eg. between `use function` and `use const`). Also enforces zero number of lines between same types of `use`.

Sniff provides the following settings:

* `linesCountBeforeFirstUse`: allows to configure the number of lines before first `use`.
* `linesCountBetweenUseTypes`: allows to configure the number of lines between two different types of `use`.
* `linesCountAfterLastUse`: allows to configure the number of lines after last `use`.
