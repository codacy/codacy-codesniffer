Detect class member access on object instantiation/cloning.
PHP 5. 4: Class member access on instantiation has been added, e. g.  `(new Foo)->bar()`. 
PHP 7. 0: Class member access on cloning has been added, e. g.  `(clone $foo)->bar()`. 

As of PHP 7. 0, class member access on instantiation also works when using curly braces. 
While unclear, this most likely has to do with the Uniform Variable Syntax changes.
