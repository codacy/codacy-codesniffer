Detect closures and verify that the features used are supported.
Version based checks:
- Closures are available since PHP 5. 3. 
- Closures can be declared as `static` since PHP 5. 4. 
- Closures can use the `$this` variable within a class context since PHP 5. 4. 
- Closures can use `self`/`parent`/`static` since PHP 5. 4. 

Version independent checks:
- Static closures don't have access to the `$this` variable. 
- Closures declared outside of a class context don't have access to the `$this`
  variable unless bound to an object.
