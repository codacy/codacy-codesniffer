Checks against empty statements.
- Check against two semi-colons with no executable code in between. 
- Check against an empty PHP open - close tag combination. 

{@internal This check should at some point in the future be pulled upstream and probably
           merged into the upstream `Generic. CodeAnalysis. EmptyStatement` sniff. 
           This will need to wait until the WPCS minimum requirements have gone up
           beyond PHPCS 3. x though as it is not likely that new features will be accepted
           still for the PHPCS 2. x branch. }}
