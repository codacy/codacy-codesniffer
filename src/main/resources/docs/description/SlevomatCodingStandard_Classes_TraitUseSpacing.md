Sniff provides the following settings:

* `linesCountBeforeFirstUse`: allows to configure the number of lines before first `use`.
* `linesCountBeforeFirstUseWhenFirstInClass`: allows to configure the number of lines before first `use` when the `use` is the first statement in the class.
* `linesCountBetweenUses`: allows to configure the number of lines between two `use` statements.
* `linesCountAfterLastUse`: allows to configure the number of lines after last `use`.
* `linesCountAfterLastUseWhenLastInClass`: allows to configure the number of lines after last `use` when the `use` is the last statement in the class.
