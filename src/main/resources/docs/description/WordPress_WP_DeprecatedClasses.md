Restricts the use of deprecated WordPress classes and suggests alternatives.
This sniff will throw an error when usage of a deprecated class is detected
if the class was deprecated before the minimum supported WP version;
a warning otherwise. 
By default, it is set to presume that a project will support the current
WP version and up to three releases before.
