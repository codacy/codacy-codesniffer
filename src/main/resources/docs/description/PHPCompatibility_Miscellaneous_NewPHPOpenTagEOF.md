PHP 7.4 now supports stand-alone PHP tags at the end of a file (without new line).

{@internal Due to an issue with the Tokenizer, this sniff will not work correctly
           on PHP 5. 3 in combination with PHPCS < 2. 6. 0 when short_open_tag is `On`. 
           As this is causing "Undefined offset" notices, there is nothing we can
           do to work-around this. }
