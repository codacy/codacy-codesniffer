Use lowercase letters in action and filter names. Separate words via underscores.This sniff is only testing the hook invoke functions as when using 'add_action'/'add_filter'
you can't influence the hook name.

Hook names invoked with `do_action_deprecated()` and `apply_filters_deprecated()` are ignored.
