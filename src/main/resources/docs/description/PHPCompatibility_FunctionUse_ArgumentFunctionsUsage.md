- Calling these functions from the outermost scope of a file which has been included by
  calling `include` or `require` from within a function in the calling file, worked
  prior to PHP 5. 3.  As of PHP 5. 3, this will generate a warning and will always return false/-1. 
  If the file was called directly or included in the global scope, calls to these
  functions would already generate a warning prior to PHP 5. 3.
